# TypeScript Project Template

This is just a minimal compilation of packages and configuration I like to use when setting up a new TypeScript project.
It's not intended to be _"the best"_ setup just what I like to use. The template is based on:
- TypeScript
- ESLint (airbnb w/ modification)
- Babel (full es6)
- Prettier
- Nodemon
- Jest
- VSCode configuration to work with prettier
- GitHub template for pull requests

Feel free to start your project based on this.
